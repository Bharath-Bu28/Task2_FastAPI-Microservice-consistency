# Task2_FastAPI-Microservice-consistency
Build a FastAPI Python 3.12 microservice with three APIs: POST /abacus/number to add N to a running sum, GET /abacus/sum to return it, and DELETE /abacus/sum to reset. It must handle high POST load, low GET load, remain correct across multiple nodes, ensure strong consistency, and allow local simulation of at least two running nodes.
